I hope I didn't post in the wrong subreddit. Hello guys, I am an IT student on my 2nd semester. In this semester, I am taking the 'Operating System' course, which requires us to use Linux (we study using Ubuntu's terminal, which is like cmd in Windows). In my college, we study using the college's computer, which has Linux as the OS. But in my home, I'm using my notebook, which has Windows 8 as the OS, so I can't study the materials given at college and I dont have money to buy a new notebook.

Hi, I'm very new to linux (12.10 or quantal (queztopretzal-not the correct name.)) and I've been attempting to make a bootable FULL install of Linux to my 16 GB flash drive. The last attempt I made had me partition my flash drive into two section ext3 and ntfs. I'm just not sure how to do it. If anyone could point towards a tutorial that would be great. I already know about putting the iso or disc image onto my flash drive and that's not what I want. This is the tutorial I used. I believe. · В этом видио рассказано, как можно создать live cd на базе Ubuntu 16.04 на флешке. Bios: ASRock UEFI Setup Utility Bios: ASRock UEFI Setup Utility. I know there was a very similar post about this a year ago but it was not exactly focused on this topic so I thought that the post could be helpful for both potential buyers and current owners of the GPD Pocket (I do not own one yet). The question is: What do you mainly use GPD Pocket/2 for? (if you own the device but you are not longer using it or you barely use it, your comments are also useful). · Добрый вечер уважаемые форумчане,не велите казнить,но подскажите туниядцу,где найти портабильную версию Thunderbird для UBUNTU ?И какую версию лучше установить?Есть ли долгоиграющая версия как. I just got a PC for free and is powerful enough to do games up to ps2 I think. I want to make it into an emulation machine. It has windows Vista on it now. But I could put Retropie Linux on it. What do you think would give be better performance and experience? Linux it Windows. 
I've posted a few topics on running Linux distros on an old netbook. It's just too slow, and while iw3 ran well I am just too inexperienced. I decided to jump into the deep end and use Ubuntu on my nicer machine. 10 GB of RAM vs 2 makes a big difference. I was debating Linux Mint or some official flavor of Ubuntu such as Ubuntu MATE, or Xubuntu and I decided to go straight OG regular Ubuntu, in part because finding help topics is easier. So far, so good. I have found replacement programs. looking for a nice small labtop/tablet for linux use and to mod/tinker with. is this labtop good for this? and as the topic says. what do you guys mainly use it for and why did you get this over others PS. cheapest/safe I have a laptop of fairly average specs but low internal storage and I'm interested in running Ubuntu from an external source such as a USB or a portable HDD. I am looking to have this as a permanent operating system that will get a lot of use. I have read from many sources that a USB flash drive is not suitable due to the finite number of read/write operations. If anybody could point me in the direction of a device that would be suitable for this task then that would be greatly appreciated. Hello all, I have looked online and through Reddit and can not seen to find what i am looking for. I am looking to run Ubuntu solely off my portable (1TB) this way i can float it to other PCs in the house. I am sure their is a Reddit or website out there if you can be so kind and point me in the right directions. So I'm a second year Theoretical Physics undergrad, and I'm looking at getting a new laptop for univerity/taking around. My main focus is portability, but obviously any potential computation I'd have to do does come into my mind. I'm currently using a Macbook Pro, but as I recently built a gaming PC I have become much more comfortable with windows. In my first year I did a module on C++, and for the stuff we were doing I had to use the lab computers as getting anything going on OS X was a nightm. I have been looking everywhere for something comparable to my N900 which was beautiful for its time. Even to this day. Just slow by today's standards. I really want something I can pocket and also, run Linux "whether x86 or ARM" but haven't come across the sweet spot for my tastes. I've looked at: Raspberry pi2 with touchscreen - unless there's a case with a rechargeable battery and built in keyboard, not in my taste. PocketChip - close to what I'm looking for but it's very clunky, and still. 
I'm looking for a non-Android, mostly standard Linux device with the following requirements: - WiFi (at least b/g, n would be even better) - BT (HID / audio) - Good power management - Removable battery - Removable storage (microSD) - Active development environment - Recent toolchains - USB host / OTG - Video out (MHL / HDMI) Would the fx0 running Firefox OS be a good target for this? So far, from my research, it's got most of that, save USB host and video out. I don't really plan on using. Apologies to the mods if this is an inappropriate question (or for the xpost to chrubuntu). Given the number of problems people seem to encounter running crouton on chromebooks at least initially, I stopped to wonder why they don't just buy a notebook more readily suited to Ubuntu. Is it that they bought a chromebook and then realize Chrome O/S is not for them? or that they want a cheaper/more expendible notebook for everyday carry and the netbook space is sparer than a few years I've been considering installing some flavor of linux on one of my machines for several months. I'm still trying to decide what the best option would be. I have three scenarios in mind, none of which are mutually exclusive. 1) Install linux on my desktop that I hardly ever use. Currently it is running Windows 7. I can't decide if I'd rather save what I want, wipe the hard drive, and do a completely clean linux install; or keep Windows 7 and set up some sort of dual boot scenario. 
I was assembling a bare-bones computer from spare components when I realized that I didn't have a hard drive, however I did find a spare 16 GB flash drive. So I figured I could just boot from my Win7 install disk and install the OS on my flash drive, but the installer didn't detect the USB flash drive. I tried googling some solutions but all I could find was tutorials and how turn a USB drive into an intsaller. TL;DR: I want to use a USB drive as my main drive, but thew Windows installer doesn'. </p>
